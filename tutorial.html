    <h1>Battle Tutorial</h1>
    <p>Some choices will lead you to a battle. In a battle, you are a red heart that you can move with [W, A, S, D] or [UpArrow, LeftArrow, DownArrow, RightArrow]</p>
    <p>Attacks will start as soon as the battle starts, so be on your toes. If you get hit, everything freezes and you lose 1 HP</p>
    <p>The more frames you survive in the attack, the more energy you will get. Energy can be used to fight, act, or heal. Fighting and Acting will decrease you HP by one.</p>
    <p>HP is your health. If your HP reaches zero, you die and must restart the game, so always try to heal. Furthermore, healing can take your health above the max (10HP).</p>
    <p>Another Attack will start as soon as your energy is below 5. If your energy is below five and an attack has not started, click the heal button to start it.</p>
    <p>Fighting will decrease the Boss' Health. if the boss health reaches 0, you win and return to the story.</p>
    <p>Acting will increase the chance the battle will and randomly. It is guaranteed after acting 20 times.</p>
    <p>Some fights will prohibit you from acting or fighting.</p>
    <p>The Catfish attack hitbox is large than it seems.</p>

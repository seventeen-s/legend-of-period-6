    <p>Another Attack will start as soon as your energy is below 5. If your energy is below five and an attack has not started, click the heal button to start it.</p>
    <p>Fighting will decrease the Boss' Health. if the boss health reaches 0, you win and return to the story.</p>
    <p>Acting will increase the chance the battle will and randomly. It is guaranteed after acting 20 times.</p>
    <p>Some fights will prohibit you from acting or fighting.</p>
